# About {-}
This document is designed to show the process of data processing, exploration and analyses that I am using on the data collected for the research project on methamphetamine use, driving behaviour, aggression and attitudes.  

The purpose of this document is to be transparent with how the data is screened and cleaned, explored and then analysed.  

As data collection is still ongoing, this document will be updated periodically when new data is made available.  

## Packages Used {-}
The following packages were used in the processing, exploration and analyses of the data:

- tidyverse
- lubridate
