There will be particular attention paid on the relationship between the predictors and the outcome variable and we will seek to graphically identify whether there may be an y interactions present between the predictor variables and MA use on the DDDI. 3.1 STAXI-2 3.1.1 State Anger (STAXI-S) DDDI by STAXI-S (ignoring MA) DDDI by STAXI-S (Stratified by MA) 3.1.2 Trait Anger (STAXI-T) DDDI by STAXI-T (ignoring MA) DDDI by STAXI-T (stratified by MA Use) DDDI Subscales by STAXI-T (stratified by MA Use) 3.2 K6 Distress Scale 3.3 SDS Scale Bivariate relationship between SDS and DDDI and STAXI and stuff screened %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = meth_SDS, y = DDDI_Total)) + geom_point() ## Warning: Removed 187 rows containing missing values (geom_point). screened %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = meth_SDS, y = T_Ang_Total)) + geom_point() ## Warning: Removed 187 rows containing missing values (geom_point). 3.4 Drug Use 3.4.1 Alcohol 3.5 Attitudes 3.5.1 DUI 3.6 Correlation Matrix DDDI_Total k6_total S_Ang_Total T_Ang_Total DUI_attitude_Total DUID_attitude_Total DDDI_Total 1.00 k6_total 0.59*** 1.00 S_Ang_Total 0.67*** 0.49*** 1.00 T_Ang_Total 0.65*** 0.44*** 0.71*** 1.00 DUI_attitude_Total 0.59*** 0.53*** 0.49*** 0.40*** 1.00 DUID_attitude_Total 0.58*** 0.48*** 0.42*** 0.34*** 0.56*** 1.00 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
