Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always). The total score can be used as a composite measure for ones tendency and/or willingness to engage in dangerous driving. Scores can range from 27 to 135. 2.3.1.1.1 Subscales: Aggressive Driving: Assessed with 7 items which reflect behaviours that are intentionally meant to annoy, irritate or punish other drivers. E.g. I flash my headlights when I am annoyed by another driver. Scores range from 7 to 35. Negative Emotional Driving: Assessed with 9 items which gauge irritability and anger while driving and the tendency to become annoyed with other drivers. E.g. I lose my temper while driving. Scores range from 9 to 45. Risky Driving: Assessed with 11 items which gauge ones willingness to engage in unsafe driving behaviours. E.g. I will drag race other drivers at stop lights to get out front. Scores range from 11 to 55. \\(^*\\)The present study used 27 items with one item from the Risky Driving subscale - I will weave in and out of slower traffic - omitted from the questionnaire. 2.3.1.2 Total Score 2.3.1.3 Aggressive Driving 2.3.1.4 Negative Emotional Driving 2.3.1.5 Risky Driving 2.3.2 STAXI-2 2.3.2.1 About The State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI-2) is designed to understand the attitudes, emotional states and behaviours that are typical to a person in regard to their feelings, control and expression of anger.
