Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always). The total score can be used as a composite measure for ones tendency and/or willingness to engage in dangerous driving. Scores can range from 27 to 135. Subscales: Aggressive Driving: Assessed with 7 items which reflect behaviours that are intentionally meant to annoy, irritate or punish other drivers. E.g. I flash my headlights when I am annoyed by another driver. Scores range from 7 to 35. Negative Emotional Driving: Assessed with 9 items which gauge irritability and anger while driving and the tendency to become annoyed with other drivers. E.g. I lose my temper while driving. Scores range from 9 to 45. Risky Driving: Assessed with 11 items which gauge ones willingness to engage in unsafe driving behaviours. E.g. I will drag race other drivers at stop lights to get out front. Scores range from 11 to 55. \\(^*\\)The present study used 27 items with one item from the Risky Driving subscale - I will weave in and out of slower traffic - omitted from the questionnaire.

It distinguishes anger between being a passing/present state as a personality trait. The full STAXI-2 contains 57 items grouped into 12 subscales which lie under three factors (State Anger, Trait Anger and Anger Control and Expression). For the purposes of this study, only the subscacles relating to State and Trait Anger were used. Scoring Each Item on the STAXI-2 is rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 (Not al all/Almost Never) to 4 (Very much so/Almost Always). Total score for State or Trait Anger is obtained by adding up the items from each subscale. Total scores for the subscales are obtained by adding up the scores of each item for the corresponding subscale. State Anger Assesses the intensity of the individuals angry feelings at time of testing. Subscales: Feeling Angry (S-Ang/F): Measures the intensity of the angry feelings the person may be experiencing. Feel like verbally expressing anger (S-Ang/V): Measures the intensity of the current feelings related to the verbal expression of anger. Feel like physically expressing anger (A-Ang/P): Measures the intensity of the current feelings related to the physical expression of anger. Trait Anger Measures the general tendency of a person to get angry. Subscales: Angry Temperament (T-Ang/T): Measures the disposition to experience anger without specific provocation. Angry Reaction (T-Ang/T): Measures the frequency with which angry feelings are experienced in situations that involve frustration and/or negative evaluations.

It measures distress for the period 4 weeks prior to administration of the test. Each Item is rated on a 5-point\\(^*\\) likert scale ranging from 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time). Total score is obtained by simply adding up the item scores together. \\(^*\\)The present study used a 4-point scale for the item During the past 30 days, about how often did you feel depressed? with the level A little of the time omitted from the survey. Numeric summary Overall K6 Distress Scores Overall(N=245) K6 Distress Score Mean (SD) 12.6 (4.57) Median [Min, Max] 12.0 [6.00, 28.0] Missing 3 (1.2%) K6 Distress Scores for MA Users Overall(N=58) K6 Distress Score Mean (SD) 17.4 (4.94) Median [Min, Max] 17.0 [9.00, 28.0] Missing 1 (1.7%) K6 Distress Scores for non-MA Users Overall(N=187) K6 Distress Score Mean (SD) 11.2 (3.30) Median [Min, Max] 11.0 [6.00, 24.0] Missing 2 (1.1%) K6 Distribution 2.3.4 Severity Dependence Scale (SDS) The SDS is a 5 item questionnaire that provides a score indicating the severity of dependence on a given substance. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, with a higher score indicating greater dependence. Those whose total score is above 4 are considered to be dependent users. Overall(N=58) SDS Mean (SD) 7.43 (2.51) Median [Min, Max] 8.00 [0, 11.0] 2.3.5 Attitudes Two questionnaires designed to assess participants attitudes toward drink and drug driving were administered. Each questionnaire included 10 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale indicating to what extend the participant agreed or disagreed with the statement (e.g. My community needs stricter laws against drink driving). After taking into account items that were reverse scored (e.g. Its OK to drive after drinking as long as youre not too drunk), total scores were calculated with higher scores indicating a more favourable attitude toward drink or drug driving.
