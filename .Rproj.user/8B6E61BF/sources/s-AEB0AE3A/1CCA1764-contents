# About {-}
This document is designed to show the process of data processing, exploration and analyses that I am using on the data collected for the research project on methamphetamine use, driving behaviour, aggression and attitudes.  

The purpose of this document is to be transparent with how the data is screened and cleaned, explored and then analysed.  

As data collection is still ongoing, this document will be updated periodically when new data is made available.  

## Packages Used {-}
The following packages were used in the processing, exploration and analyses of the data:

- tidyverse
- lubridate


## Usage (ignore) {-}

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book (ignore) {-}

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.
